# Algora DSA Curriculum — Pattern-Based Problem Roadmap **v3.0**

> **Status:** Supersedes v2.0 (240-day topic-per-day lecture syllabus, scored 94.5/100).
> **This version shifts from theory-first to question-first:** every topic is taught through
> curated problems, not lecture videos. The pattern-dependency roadmap replaces the daily schedule.
> **Change model:** the pedagogical framework (SRS, Cold Opens, Assessment, Readiness Score) is
> unchanged. Only the *delivery format* changes: from "Day X: Topic" to "Pattern → Problems."
>
> **Every problem appears exactly once.** When a problem uses multiple patterns (e.g., Trapping
> Rain Water uses both two pointers and stack), it is placed in the pattern where it is *first
> naturally taught*. Students recognize connections to earlier patterns — that is the point.

## Part A — Primary Avatar & Promise

**Primary avatar (declared publicly, on the landing page and in Day 1):**

> A 2nd- or 3rd-year CS student, or a working developer with 0–3 years experience,
> who can write a `for` loop in one language and is targeting **product-company / FAANG-bar
> coding interviews within 8 months**.

**Explicit non-avatars:** absolute programming beginners (they need a language course first),
and active competitive programmers rated 1600+ (Track B alone will not be enough for them).

**The promise, stated as a measurable outcome:**

> By completing this roadmap you will have solved **227 curated problems** across **19 pattern
> groups**, passed **pattern-level assessments** and **mock interviews**, and be able to
> identify the right pattern for a problem you have never seen.

**What we do not promise:** that watching solutions makes you employable.
Understanding comes from struggling with the problem first. Interviews test ability.

---

## Part B — Track A / Track B Split

Every pattern group carries a track label. Students are told upfront exactly what they may skip.

| Track | Label | Patterns | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | Core | 16 pattern groups | Mandatory. Interview-load-bearing. Gates the Readiness Score. |
| **B** | Advanced / Competitive | 3 pattern groups | Optional. Marked `[B]`. Skipping does **not** lower the Readiness Score. |

Track B patterns: Advanced Graphs, Math & Geometry (advanced), String Algorithms.

> **Why this matters:** retention improves when students are told what they may skip.
> An undeclared audience loses the beginner at hard graph problems and bores the CP student at basic arrays.

---

## Part C — Practice Architecture

**v3.0 rule: every problem is the lesson. The solution video is the reward, not the starting point.**

For each problem, the student flow is:

```
1. READ the problem statement (2 min)
2. THINK & attempt for 15-25 min (timer visible)
3. If stuck → reveal HINT 1, then HINT 2 (progressive)
4. WATCH the solution video only AFTER attempting
5. CODE the solution yourself (no copy-paste)
6. EXPLAIN the approach out loud (interview prep)
```

**Per pattern group, problems are tiered:**

| Tier | Purpose | Count per pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Learn** | First exposure. Watch the concept + walkthrough. | 2–4 Easy problems |
| **Practice** | Same pattern, harder surface. Must solve independently. | 4–8 Medium problems |
| **Challenge** | Pattern twisted, combined, or constraint-shifted. Interview-level. | 1–3 Hard problems |

**Volume math**

```
19 pattern groups × avg 12 problems    = 227 unique problems
Pattern assessments (5 per pattern)    =  95 assessment exposures
Mock interviews (12 × 2 problems)      =  24 problems
SRS re-exposures (from completed)      = ~400 retrieval events
------------------------------------------------------------
Total problem exposures                ≈ 746
Unique problems                        = 227
```

> **Why 227, not 500?** Quality over quantity. Every problem is hand-picked for interview
> relevance. Students who deeply understand 227 problems across all patterns will outperform
> those who grind 500 random problems without pattern recognition.

---

## Part D — Retention Engine: SRS & Cold Opens

### D.1 — The Cold Open (5 minutes, every video)

Every solution video opens with **one problem the platform selected from the student's SRS queue**,
drawn from a pattern **the student completed ≥7 days ago**. Student attempts it before the
new problem solution is shown.

### D.2 — Spaced intervals

Each mastered problem is re-served at **1, 3, 7, 21, 60 days**, then on a 120-day tail.

| Touch | Interval | Vehicle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Day 0 | The problem itself |
| 2 | +1 day | Quick recall quiz |
| 3 | +3 days | SRS queue (similar problem) |
| 4 | +7 days | Pattern assessment |
| 5 | +21 days | Cold Open |
| 6 | +60 days | Cross-pattern mixed exam |
| 7 | +120 days | Mock interview |

### D.3 — Failure routing

A missed SRS item resets that problem to interval 1 **and** injects the problem's
hint sequence + the key technique clip (30–60 s) into the student's feed.

---

## Part E — Assessment: Exams, Rubrics & Readiness Score

### E.1 — Pattern assessment (after each pattern group)

- **Timed:** 45 minutes, 5 problems.
- **Interleaved:** 3 from this pattern, 2 from any earlier pattern (SRS-selected).
- **Scored** and published against a rubric.

### E.2 — Section exam (after every 4–5 patterns)

- **Timed:** 120 minutes, 8 problems, **fully mixed across all completed patterns**.
- The section exam is an *exam*, not a recap.

### E.3 — Rubric (published, identical every assessment)

| Band | Score | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ready** | ≥ 85% | Proceed. Unlock next Track B pattern. |
| **Proceed** | 70–84% | Proceed. SRS weights the misses up. |
| **Remediate** | 50–69% | Run the prescribed **remediation set** before continuing. |
| **Reset** | < 50% | Repeat the pattern's Practice tier. Non-negotiable gate. |

Each problem is scored on four axes:

| Axis | Weight |
| :--- | :--- |
| Correctness (all tests, including edge cases) | 40% |
| Optimal complexity achieved | 25% |
| Code clarity & invariant handling | 15% |
| Verbal/written explanation of *why* it works | 20% |

### E.4 — DSA Readiness Score

A single visible 0–100 number.

- Moves **only** on cold-retrieval performance: SRS items, timed assessments, mocks.
- **Never** moves on video completion, streaks, or time spent.
- Decays if SRS queue is neglected.

> Students should be able to say "I am at 71" and know exactly what that means.

## Part F — The 5-Slot DP State Template

Every DP problem (Patterns 15–16) renders the same five slots on screen, in the same place,
in the same order, without exception:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. WHAT VARIES?        →  the state:      dp[i], dp[i][j]   │
│ 2. CHOICES AT A STATE  →  the transition: take / skip / ... │
│ 3. BASE CASES          →  smallest valid states             │
│ 4. ORDER OF COMPUTATION→  which index must exist first      │
│ 5. SPACE REDUCTION     →  2D → 1D → O(1) rolling            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The slots are the lesson. The named problem is only the vehicle.

## Part G — Pattern-Based Problem Roadmap (227 unique problems)

> **Format:** Each pattern group lists problems in difficulty order (Easy → Medium → Hard).
> Every problem includes: LeetCode number, difficulty, key technique, and top company tags.

## Part K — Design Principles

Principles 1–16 are from v2.0, preserved — they are the curriculum's pedagogical backbone.

1. **Every video = one concept.** Never overload with two major ideas.
2. **Visualization first, code second.** The student sees the algorithm think before they see syntax.
3. **Every concept connects backward.** State prerequisites explicitly; reuse prior structures.
4. **Every concept connects forward.** Show what this unlocks.
5. **Interleave review.** Every assessment includes problems from earlier patterns.
6. **Varied cognitive tasks.** Rotate predict, trace, implement, debug, explain, compare.
7. **No guessing allowed.** Students predict before they see the answer. Platform validates.
8. **Misconception-first.** Address the most common wrong model *before* teaching the right one.
9. **Daily consistency beats marathon sessions.** Solve 2–3 problems per day, not 20 in a marathon.
10. **Interview readiness = transfer + explanation.** Not just passing tests.

11. **Videos create understanding; problems create ability.** Interviews test ability. The problem
    is the product; the video walkthrough is the reward.
12. **Nothing is learned until it is retrieved cold.** SRS retrieval from earlier patterns is
    mandatory. No exceptions.
13. **Teach the pattern, not the problem.** If a family has a shape (DP's 5 slots, backtracking's
    choose/explore/un-choose, monotonic invariants), the shape is the lesson.
14. **Every gate is measured and published.** No band without a rubric. No progression without a
    score. The Readiness Score moves only on cold retrieval — never on watch time.
15. **Declare what may be skipped.** Track B is labelled on every pattern. Honest optionality raises
    completion; undeclared difficulty destroys it.
16. **Prove transfer on camera.** At least once, derive an unseen problem live, wrong turns
    included. A rehearsed solution proves nothing.

**New in v3.0:**

17. **Question first, theory second.** Students read the problem, struggle with it, then watch the
    solution. The struggle is where learning happens. Theory is delivered *through* problems.
18. **Pattern over problem.** Students should recognize "this is a sliding window problem" before
    they remember "this is LeetCode 76." Pattern recognition is the transferable skill.
19. **Real problems, real names.** Use LeetCode/GFG problem names students will encounter
    everywhere. Don't invent proprietary names for the same problems — students cross-reference.
20. **Dependency-driven progression.** The pattern graph tells students exactly what to learn next.
    No artificial 240-day schedule — learn at your own pace, following the prerequisite arrows.
21. **Zero duplicates.** Every problem appears exactly once in the roadmap. When a problem uses
    multiple patterns, it lives in the first pattern where it is naturally taught. Students
    recognize connections to earlier patterns — that recognition *is* the learning.

## Part L — Production & Sustainability Plan

### L.1 — YouTube content cadence

| Rule | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Batch one full pattern before publishing** | All videos for a pattern group finished before the first one goes live. |
| **2–3 videos per pattern group** | Large patterns (Trees: 22 problems) split into 3–4 videos. Small patterns (Tries: 6 problems) = 1–2 videos. |
| **Each video covers 3–5 problems** | Brief pattern intro (2–3 min) → solve problems on screen → recap pattern. |
| **Publish 3–4 videos per week** | Sustainable pace. Pattern-based means no arbitrary daily pressure. |
| **Problem walkthrough format is cheap** | Screen + voice + code editor. No heavy animation needed for each problem. |

### L.2 — Effort budget

| Asset class | Count | Hrs each | Total |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Pattern intro + walkthrough video | ~50 | 6 | 300 |
| Pattern assessment creation | 19 | 3 | 57 |
| Section exams | 4 | 5 | 20 |
| Mock interviews | 12 | 4 | 48 |
| Problem authoring (227 problems w/ tests + metadata) | — | — | ~230 |
| Platform problem integration | — | — | ~70 |
| **Total** | | | **~725 hrs** |

At 35 productive hours/week that is **~21 weeks of work** — significantly more sustainable than
v2.0's ~54 weeks. The pattern-based format is inherently cheaper to produce because problem
walkthroughs require less animation than concept videos.

### L.3 — The one thing to protect

If schedule pressure hits, **cut Track B patterns before cutting problem quality or assessments.**
Track B is 3 optional pattern groups. The curated problems and the SRS engine are the entire
reason this curriculum beats a free YouTube playlist or random LeetCode grinding.

## Part M — Changelog v2.0 → v3.0

| # | Change | v2.0 | v3.0 | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Theory-first → Question-first** | 240 daily concept videos | 19 pattern groups, 227 curated problems | Students learn by doing, not watching |
| 2 | **Daily schedule → Dependency graph** | Day 1, Day 2, ... Day 240 (linear) | Pattern prerequisite graph (flexible pace) | Self-paced; no artificial daily pressure |
| 3 | **Topic names → Real problem names** | "Day 18: Fixed-Size Sliding Window" | "Sliding Window: Minimum Window Substring (LC #76)" | Students recognize problems across platforms |
| 4 | **1,300 platform problems → 227 curated** | Quantity-first (1,300 w/ SRS) | Quality-first (227 hand-picked, zero duplicates) | Every problem has a reason for being there |
| 5 | **240 videos → ~50 videos** | One video per day, 240 total | 2–3 videos per pattern, ~50 total | More sustainable production; higher quality per video |
| 6 | **Company tags added** | No company info | Every problem tagged with top companies | Students prioritize based on target company |
| 7 | **Pattern recognition explicit** | Implicit in topic ordering | Each group teaches a named, reusable pattern | The transferable skill is the pattern, not the problem |
| 8 | **Zero duplicate policy** | Same problem in multiple contexts | Each problem appears exactly once | No confusion; students build on prior patterns naturally |

### What was preserved unchanged

- SRS & Cold Open retention engine (Part D)
- 4-band assessment rubric (Part E)
- DSA Readiness Score (Part E.4)
- 5-Slot DP State Template (Part F)

> **This document is the canonical reference for Algora's DSA content pipeline.**
> **Version 3.0.** Supersedes v2.0 in full.
>
> The shift from v2.0 to v3.0 is format, not philosophy: teach through problems, not lectures.
> Every pedagogical system (SRS, assessment, readiness scoring) is preserved.
> The question is now the lesson. Every problem appears exactly once.
